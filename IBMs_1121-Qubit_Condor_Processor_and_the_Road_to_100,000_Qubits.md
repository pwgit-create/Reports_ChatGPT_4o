# IBM’s 1,121-Qubit **Condor** Processor and the Road to 100,000 Qubits

## IBM’s **Condor** Quantum Processor (1,121 Qubits) 
IBM has confirmed the successful development of **“Condor,” a 1,121-qubit quantum processor** – the world’s first quantum chip to surpass one thousand superconducting qubits ([IBM Releases First-Ever 1,000-Qubit Quantum Chip | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ibm-releases-first-ever-1-000-qubit-quantum-chip/#:~:text=IBM%20has%20unveiled%20the%20first,resistant%20rather%20than%20larger)) ([The 2023 IBM Research annual letter - IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/blog/research-annual-letter-2023#:~:text=Condor%20and%20Heron,When)). Announced at the IBM Quantum Summit in December 2023, the Condor chip contains **1,121 fixed-frequency superconducting qubits** arranged in a **heavy-hexagonal (honeycomb) pattern** of couplers ([IBM Releases First-Ever 1,000-Qubit Quantum Chip | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ibm-releases-first-ever-1-000-qubit-quantum-chip/#:~:text=IBM%20has%20unveiled%20the%20first,resistant%20rather%20than%20larger)). This honeycomb lattice connectivity is an extension of IBM’s previous “Eagle” (127 qubits) and “Osprey” (433 qubits) chip architectures, scaling up the same **cross-resonance two-qubit gate** technology used in those earlier processors ([IBM Quantum Computers: Evolution, Performance, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00916v1#:~:text=IBM%20Quantum%20has%20introduced%20IBM,within%20a%20single%20dilution%20refrigerator)). In IBM’s own words, *“At 1,121 qubits, Condor is the world’s largest quantum processor, pushing the limits of how many qubits can be fit on a single chip while yielding day in and day out”* ([The 2023 IBM Research annual letter - IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/blog/research-annual-letter-2023#:~:text=Condor%20and%20Heron,When)) – underscoring that Condor was designed to significantly increase qubit count **without compromising coherence or gate performance** relative to its predecessors.

From a high-level architectural perspective, **Condor pushes the single-chip design to its practical limits**. The chip achieves roughly **50% higher qubit density** than the 433-qubit Osprey, enabled by a larger chip **laminate (packaging substrate) and refined fabrication** techniques ([IBM announces new quantum processors and systems - DCD](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ibm-announces-new-quantum-processors-and-systems/#:~:text=A%201%2C121%20superconducting%20qubit%20quantum,help%20scale%20up%20future%20projects)). Control and readout wiring for such a large processor also required innovation: IBM integrated **over a mile of high-density cryogenic flex cabling** within the dilution refrigerator to fan-out signals to all 1,121 qubits ([IBM Quantum Computers: Evolution, Performance, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00916v1#:~:text=IBM%20Quantum%20has%20introduced%20IBM,within%20a%20single%20dilution%20refrigerator)). These engineering feats – increasing qubit density, enlarging the die and packaging, and managing massive wiring complexity – were necessary to realize Condor on a single module. The **resulting chip is still a NISQ-era device** (not error-corrected), but it serves as a crucial stepping stone in IBM’s roadmap, demonstrating that a ~1K-qubit quantum processor is feasible and can be operated with performance *“comparable to its predecessor, the 433-qubit Osprey”* ([IBM Quantum Computers: Evolution, Performance, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00916v1#:~:text=performance%20comparable%20to%20its%20predecessor%2C,43)). In summary, IBM’s Condor exists today as a **1,121-qubit superconducting processor** – officially the largest of its kind – and it showcases key architectural advances (connectivity layout, packaging, and I/O integration) needed for scaling quantum hardware into the thousand-qubit regime ([IBM Releases First-Ever 1,000-Qubit Quantum Chip | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ibm-releases-first-ever-1-000-qubit-quantum-chip/#:~:text=IBM%20has%20unveiled%20the%20first,resistant%20rather%20than%20larger)) ([IBM Quantum Computers: Evolution, Performance, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00916v1#:~:text=IBM%20Quantum%20has%20introduced%20IBM,within%20a%20single%20dilution%20refrigerator)).

## IBM’s Roadmap Toward a 100,000-Qubit Quantum System 
Having crossed the 1,000-qubit threshold with Condor, IBM is now looking ahead to vastly larger systems. **IBM’s official quantum roadmap** envisions building a **“quantum-centric supercomputer” with on the order of 100,000 qubits by 2033** ([The 2023 IBM Research annual letter - IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/blog/research-annual-letter-2023#:~:text=capable%20of%20running%20over%20a,billion%20gates%20on%202%2C000%20qubits)) ([IBM Details Road to 100,000 Qubits by 2033](https://www.iotworldtoday.com/industry/ibm-details-road-to-100-000-qubits-by-2033#:~:text=IBM%20plans%20to%20develop%20a,IBM)). In May 2023, IBM announced plans (in collaboration with partners like the University of Tokyo and University of Chicago) to develop a **100,000-qubit commercial quantum computer by 2033** ([IBM Details Road to 100,000 Qubits by 2033](https://www.iotworldtoday.com/industry/ibm-details-road-to-100-000-qubits-by-2033#:~:text=IBM%20plans%20to%20develop%20a,IBM)). This vision is predicated on moving beyond the limitations of single-chip processors like Condor. Instead of continuing to simply enlarge monolithic chips, IBM’s strategy is to **scale through modular quantum architectures** – linking multiple smaller processors into one system using quantum interconnects. IBM’s **Quantum System Two** (deployed in 2023 with 3×133-qubit “Heron” chips) is an early example of this modular approach ([The 2023 IBM Research annual letter - IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/blog/research-annual-letter-2023#:~:text=IBM%20Quantum%20System%20Two)). IBM describes these modular, networked processors as the key **“building blocks”** on the path to 100K qubits, stating that *“going beyond single chip processors is the key to solving scale…providing a clear path to 100,000 qubits and beyond with the quantum-centric supercomputer”* ([Quantum technology | IBM Quantum Learning](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/quantum-business-foundations/quantum-technology#:~:text=Going%20beyond%20single%20chip%20processors,integrate%20quantum%20and%20classical%20workflows)). 

According to IBM’s roadmap, the progression involves **multi-chip processors and quantum communication links** to incrementally increase total qubit count while maintaining quality. For example, in 2024 IBM plans to debut “Crossbill,” a chip that itself is composed of multiple smaller chips tiled together ([Quantum technology | IBM Quantum Learning](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/quantum-business-foundations/quantum-technology#:~:text=Going%20beyond%20single%20chip%20processors,integrate%20quantum%20and%20classical%20workflows)). By the late 2020s, IBM aims to integrate many such modules. The **2033 goal of ~100,000 qubits** is when IBM expects to have a fully integrated system of many quantum processing units (QPUs) working in concert, coupled with classical co-processors for error mitigation and orchestration ([The 2023 IBM Research annual letter - IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/blog/research-annual-letter-2023#:~:text=capable%20of%20running%20over%20a,billion%20gates%20on%202%2C000%20qubits)). Notably, IBM projects that such a system (~100K physical qubits) could support on the order of **“thousands of logical qubits”** after error correction and be capable of executing **1 billion quantum gate operations** in a single run ([www.ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com/roadmaps/quantum/#:~:text=2033%2B)) ([The 2023 IBM Research annual letter - IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/blog/research-annual-letter-2023#:~:text=capable%20of%20running%20over%20a,billion%20gates%20on%202%2C000%20qubits)). While 100,000 physical qubits is still an **aspirational target**, IBM’s confidence is backed by a track record of hitting interim milestones (e.g. 127 → 433 → 1,121 qubits as planned) ([Quantum technology | IBM Quantum Learning](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/quantum-business-foundations/quantum-technology#:~:text=Image%3A%20Development%20Roadmap)). The **timeline is roughly a decade**: IBM explicitly states 2033 as the horizon for a 100K-qubit machine that users can access (presumably via IBM’s cloud or research collaborations) ([The 2023 IBM Research annual letter - IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/blog/research-annual-letter-2023#:~:text=capable%20of%20running%20over%20a,billion%20gates%20on%202%2C000%20qubits)). This marks a shift from simply maximizing qubit count to **engineering a scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing platform** – IBM has even pivoted to emphasize error correction, introducing the smaller 133-qubit *Heron* chip with much lower error rates to serve as the “unit cell” for modular scaling ([IBM Releases First-Ever 1,000-Qubit Quantum Chip | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ibm-releases-first-ever-1-000-qubit-quantum-chip/#:~:text=As%20part%20of%20its%20new,of%20its%20previous%20quantum%20processor)). In short, IBM’s official roadmap foresees **publicly accessible quantum systems reaching ~100,000 qubits by around 2033**, enabled by modular hardware and significant improvements in qubit quality, interconnects, and error-correction technology ([The 2023 IBM Research annual letter - IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/blog/research-annual-letter-2023#:~:text=capable%20of%20running%20over%20a,billion%20gates%20on%202%2C000%20qubits)) ([Quantum technology | IBM Quantum Learning](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/quantum-business-foundations/quantum-technology#:~:text=Going%20beyond%20single%20chip%20processors,integrate%20quantum%20and%20classical%20workflows)).

## Outlook from Google and Other Experts on 100,000-Qubit Timelines 
IBM is not alone in forecasting large-scale quantum machines – **other major players like Google** have similarly bold targets. Google’s quantum computing program has openly stated a goal of building a **“useful, error-corrected quantum computer” by the end of the 2020s** (around 2029) ([Google wants to build a useful quantum computer by 2029 - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443453/google-quantum-computer-2029-decade-commercial-useful-qubits-quantum-transistor#:~:text=Google%20wants%20to%20build%20a,to%20a%20target%20of%202029)). Hitting that goal is generally believed to require on the order of **a million physical qubits** working in concert (given current error-correction overheads). In fact, Google is *“targeting a million qubits by the end of the decade”* as a milestone on its roadmap ([Quantum computing: What leaders need to know now | MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/quantum-computing-what-leaders-need-to-know-now#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20still%20early%20days%2C%20but,53%20Fortune%20Business)). This implies that **Google expects to surpass the 100,000-qubit scale sometime in the latter half of this decade**. Achieving a million physical qubits would likely involve Google’s own approach to modular scaling and dense qubit integration (for example, Google’s newest prototype chips like “Sycamore” and “Willow” are exploring improved error rates and tiled architectures ([Making quantum error correction work - Google Research](https://research.google/blog/making-quantum-error-correction-work/#:~:text=Making%20quantum%20error%20correction%20work,better%20as%20they%20get%20bigger))). While Google hasn’t published a detailed year-by-year qubit roadmap like IBM’s, its leaders have made strong predictions: **Hartmut Neven** and others have suggested Google is on track for a large-scale fault-tolerant machine by 2029, after which the company would make it available via Google’s cloud services ([Google wants to build a useful quantum computer by 2029 - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443453/google-quantum-computer-2029-decade-commercial-useful-qubits-quantum-transistor#:~:text=Google%20wants%20to%20build%20a,to%20a%20target%20of%202029)) ([Quantum computing: What leaders need to know now | MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/quantum-computing-what-leaders-need-to-know-now#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20still%20early%20days%2C%20but,53%20Fortune%20Business)). This timeline puts **100,000 physical qubits as a mid-point goal perhaps around 2027–2028** for Google if all goes well, since they’d need to ramp up into the hundreds of thousands on the way to a million. 

Beyond IBM and Google, several **quantum industry experts and roadmaps** provide projections for the 100K-qubit era. One analysis noted that the **rate of increase in qubit counts has been exponential**, roughly doubling annually or better. For instance, IBM’s qubit count grew at an average **158% per year through 2023**, extrapolating which *“100,000 qubits by 2030 seems a reasonable bet”* if the trend continues ([Quantum Computers: A Technology Assessment - EE Times Europe](https://www.eetimes.eu/quantum-computers-a-technology-assessment/#:~:text=would%20be%20needed,2030%20seems%20a%20reasonable%20bet)). This kind of **trend analysis** suggests that technologically we could reach five-figure or low six-figure qubit scales as early as the **beginning of the 2030s**, assuming no fundamental roadblocks emerge. Some experts are even more aggressive – back in 2020, IBM researchers spoke of a **“moonshot” goal of 1 million qubits by 2030** ([The timelines: when can we expect useful quantum computers? | Introduction to Quantum Computing for Business](https://introtoquantum.org/essentials/timelines/#:~:text=million%20qubits%20as%20a%20%E2%80%98moonshot%E2%80%99,up%20PsiQuantum%2C%20which%20made%20waves)), and the start-up **PsiQuantum** has aimed to build a million-qubit photonic quantum computer on a similar timeframe ([The timelines: when can we expect useful quantum computers? | Introduction to Quantum Computing for Business](https://introtoquantum.org/essentials/timelines/#:~:text=million%20qubits%20as%20a%20%E2%80%98moonshot%E2%80%99,up%20PsiQuantum%2C%20which%20made%20waves)). These ambitious visions imply crossing the 100,000-qubit mark several years before 2030. On the other hand, many in the field caution that simply amassing qubits is not enough – **error rates and connectivity** must improve in tandem. As a Nature news article reported in 2023, *“Researchers have generally said that state-of-the-art error-correction techniques will require more than 1,000 physical qubits for each logical qubit. A machine that can do useful computations would then need to have millions of physical qubits.”* ([IBM Releases First-Ever 1,000-Qubit Quantum Chip | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ibm-releases-first-ever-1-000-qubit-quantum-chip/#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20generally%20said%20that,have%20millions%20of%20physical%20qubits)). This perspective suggests that while 100,000 physical qubits might be reachable in the next ~8–10 years, **truly practical quantum computing (with error-corrected logical qubits)** may still demand an order of magnitude beyond that. NVIDIA’s CEO **Jensen Huang**, for example, estimated that practical fault-tolerant quantum computers are *“15 to 30 years away”* – pointing to the formidable challenge of scaling *useful* qubits, not just raw qubit count ([Our quantum computer will get 100,000x faster by 2025, Honeywell ...](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/quantum-computer-will-get-100000x-faster-by-2025-honeywell-says/#:~:text=Our%20quantum%20computer%20will%20get,it%20reenters%20the%20computing%20business)).

In summary, **predictions coalesce around the early 2030s for 100,000-qubit quantum computers to become available to users**. IBM’s official roadmap targets 100K qubits by 2033 ([The 2023 IBM Research annual letter - IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/blog/research-annual-letter-2023#:~:text=capable%20of%20running%20over%20a,billion%20gates%20on%202%2C000%20qubits)), leveraging modular **quantum interconnects** and improved qubit fidelity. **Google** is even more optimistic, effectively aiming for an error-corrected system on the order of 10^5–10^6 qubits by 2029–2030 ([Quantum computing: What leaders need to know now | MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/quantum-computing-what-leaders-need-to-know-now#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20still%20early%20days%2C%20but,53%20Fortune%20Business)). Other companies (like Quantinuum, IonQ, and PsiQuantum) and experts echo the view that **the 100,000-qubit scale will likely be reached within the next decade**, barring unexpected technical hurdles. Crucially, reaching this scale will involve not just making chips larger, but also mastering **error correction and networked qubit architectures** so that these enormous machines can be reliably used by the public. As IBM emphasizes, the end goal is a **quantum-centric supercomputer** with modular QPU clusters, capable of solving problems impossible on classical machines ([Quantum technology | IBM Quantum Learning](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/quantum-business-foundations/quantum-technology#:~:text=Going%20beyond%20single%20chip%20processors,integrate%20quantum%20and%20classical%20workflows)). The **roadmaps today suggest** that by the **early-to-mid 2030s**, we may indeed see cloud-accessible quantum computers with on the order of 100,000 physical qubits – a level that could unlock quantum advantage for certain tasks, and set the stage for the eventual million-qubit, fault-tolerant quantum era ([Quantum Computers: A Technology Assessment - EE Times Europe](https://www.eetimes.eu/quantum-computers-a-technology-assessment/#:~:text=would%20be%20needed,2030%20seems%20a%20reasonable%20bet)) ([The 2023 IBM Research annual letter - IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/blog/research-annual-letter-2023#:~:text=capable%20of%20running%20over%20a,billion%20gates%20on%202%2C000%20qubits)).
